[Quick Terminal]
[Requires Visual Studios]

SOME THINGS DO NOT WORK AT THE MOMENT

Make sure you read the license!

This project is older than Quick Terminal Server Edition, It would be amazing if someone moved some things back to the
'original' project (specially scripting),

QuickTerminal has many features that CMD and QT-SE do not have!

Try using crawl!
